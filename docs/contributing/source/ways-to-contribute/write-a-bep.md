# Write a BigchaindB Enhancement Proposal (BEP)

- Review [1/C4](https://github.com/bigchaindb/BEPs/tree/master/1), the process we use to accept any new code or PR of any kind, including one that adds a BEP to `bigchaindb/BEPs`.
- Review [2/COSS](https://github.com/bigchaindb/BEPs/tree/master/2). Maybe print it for reference. It outlines what can go in a BEP.
- Don't spend weeks on your BEP. Version 1 should take up to a few hours to write. You can add to it in the future. The process is iterative. If you need more than a few hours, then consider writing multiple BEPs.
- Do _not_ start writing code before you think about it. You should always write a BEP first. Once you do that, you can start implementing it. To do that, make a pull request and say it implements your BEP.
- Do _not_ write your BEP as an issue (i.e. a GitHub issue).
