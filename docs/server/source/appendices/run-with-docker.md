# Run BigchainDB with Docker

**NOT for Production Use**

For those who like using Docker and wish to experiment with BigchainDB in
non-production environments, we currently maintain a Docker image and a
`Dockerfile` that can be used to build an image for `bigchaindb`.

## Prerequisite(s)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

## Pull and Run the Image from Docker Hub

With Docker installed, you can proceed as follows.

In a terminal shell, pull the latest version of the BigchainDB Docker image using:
```text
docker pull bigchaindb/bigchaindb
```

### Configuration
A one-time configuration step is required to create the config file; we will use
the `-y` option to accept all the default values. The configuration file will
be stored in a file on your host machine at `~/bigchaindb_docker/.bigchaindb`:

```text
docker run \
  --interactive \
  --rm \
  --tty \
  --volume $HOME/bigchaindb_docker:/data \
  --env BIGCHAINDB_DATABASE_HOST=172.17.0.1 \
  bigchaindb/bigchaindb \
  -y configure \
  [mongodb|rethinkdb]

Generating keypair
Configuration written to /data/.bigchaindb
Ready to go!
```

Let's analyze that command:

* `docker run` tells Docker to run some image
* `--interactive` keep STDIN open even if not attached
* `--rm` remove the container once we are done
* `--tty` allocate a pseudo-TTY
* `--volume "$HOME/bigchaindb_docker:/data"` map the host directory
 `$HOME/bigchaindb_docker` to the container directory `/data`;
 this allows us to have the data persisted on the host machine,
 you can read more in the [official Docker
 documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes)
* `--env BIGCHAINDB_DATABASE_HOST=172.17.0.1`, `172.17.0.1` is the default `docker0` bridge
IP address, for fresh Docker installations. It is used for the communication between BigchainDB and database
containers.
* `bigchaindb/bigchaindb` the image to use. All the options after the container name are passed on to the entrypoint inside the container.
* `-y configure` execute the `configure` sub-command (of the `bigchaindb`
 command) inside the container, with the `-y` option to automatically use all the default config values
* `mongodb` or `rethinkdb` specifies the database backend to use with bigchaindb


### Run the backend database
From v0.9 onwards, you can run either RethinkDB or MongoDB.

You can also use docker host networking or bind to your primary (eth)
 interface, if needed.

#### For RethinkDB

```text
docker run \
  --detach \
  --name=rethinkdb \
  --publish=28015:28015 \
  --publish=58080:8080 \
  --restart=always \
  --volume $HOME/bigchaindb_docker:/data \
  rethinkdb:2.3
```

<!-- Don't hyperlink http://172.17.0.1:58080/ because Sphinx will fail when you do "make linkcheck" -->

You can also access the RethinkDB dashboard at http://172.17.0.1:58080/


#### For MongoDB

Note: MongoDB runs as user `mongodb` which had the UID `999` and GID `999`
inside the container. For the volume to be mounted properly, as user `mongodb`
in your host, you should have a `mongodb` user with UID and GID `999`.
If you have another user on the host with UID `999`, the mapped files will
be owned by this user in the host.
If there is no owner with UID 999, you can create the corresponding user and
group.

`useradd -r --uid 999 mongodb` OR `groupadd -r --gid 999 mongodb && useradd -r --uid 999 -g mongodb mongodb` should work.


```text
docker run \
  --detach \
  --name=mongodb \
  --publish=27017:27017 \
  --restart=always \
  --volume=$HOME/mongodb_docker/db:/data/db \
  --volume=$HOME/mongodb_docker/configdb:/data/configdb \
  mongo:3.4.9 --replSet=bigchain-rs
```

### Run BigchainDB

```text
docker run \
  --detach \
  --name=bigchaindb \
  --publish=59984:9984 \
  --restart=always \
  --volume=$HOME/bigchaindb_docker:/data \
  bigchaindb/bigchaindb \
  start
```

The command is slightly different from the previous one, the differences are:

* `--detach` run the container in the background
* `--name bigchaindb` give a nice name to the container so it's easier to
 refer to it later
* `--publish "59984:9984"` map the host port `59984` to the container port `9984`
 (the BigchainDB API server)
* `start` start the BigchainDB service

Another way to publish the ports exposed by the container is to use the `-P` (or
`--publish-all`) option. This will publish all exposed ports to random ports. You can
always run `docker ps` to check the random mapping.

If that doesn't work, then replace `localhost` with the IP or hostname of the
machine running the Docker engine. If you are running docker-machine (e.g. on
Mac OS X) this will be the IP of the Docker machine (`docker-machine ip
machine_name`).


## Building Your Own Image

Assuming you have Docker installed, you would proceed as follows.

In a terminal shell:
```text
git clone git@github.com:bigchaindb/bigchaindb.git
```

Build the Docker image:
```text
docker build --tag local-bigchaindb .
```

Now you can use your own image to run BigchainDB containers.
