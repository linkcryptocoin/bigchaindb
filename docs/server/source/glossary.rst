   associative array
      A collection of key/value (or name/value) pairs
      such that each possible key appears at most once
      in the collection.
      In JavaScript (and JSON), all objects behave as associative arrays
      with string-valued keys.
      In Python and .NET, associative arrays are called *dictionaries*.
      In Java and Go, they are called *maps*.
      In Ruby, they are called *hashes*.
