# Production Node Components

A production BigchainDB node must include:

* BigchainDB Server
* MongoDB Server 3.4+ (mongod)
* Tendermint
* Storage for MongoDB and Tendermint

It could also include several other components, including:

* NGINX or similar, to provide authentication, rate limiting, etc.
* An NTP daemon running on all machines running BigchainDB Server or mongod, and possibly other machines
* **Not** MongoDB Automation Agent. It's for automating the deployment of an entire MongoDB cluster, not just one MongoDB node within a cluster.
* MongoDB Monitoring Agent
* MongoDB Backup Agent
* Log aggregation software
* Monitoring software
* Maybe more

The relationship between the main components is illustrated below.
